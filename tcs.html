        <h2>About TCS NQT</h2>
        <p class="text-1">TCS National Qualifier Test (TCS NQT) is an Ability Test that assesses a candidate's competencies and skills. Each candidate who completes the TCS National Qualifier Test (TCS NQT) gets an NQT Score. The NQT (Cognitive Skills) Score is applicable
            for all industries and job roles. The TCS National Qualifier Test (TCS NQT) is planned to be conducted every quarter. Candidates can take the tests again to improve their previous scores, if desired. There are four Variants - NQT (Cognitive
            Skills), Attitudinal Alignment NQT (Psychometric Test), Industry NQT and Subject NQT. Note: NQT (Cognitive Skills) is a mandatory test to be taken to register for Attitudinal Alignment NQT (Psychometric Test), Industry NQT and Subject NQT.
            All tests will be conducted in English language only and there will be no negative marking. Candidates who have appeared for NQT earlier and would like to improve their NQT Score, can purchase NQT Variant(s) and appear for it in the upcoming
            tests. Candidates will be able to view/edit their details and add test(s) on/before the application closure date.</p>
        <p class="last-Date">Applications Open for August 2021 and November 2021 exams</p>
